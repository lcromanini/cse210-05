# Cycle
Cycle is a game where the players try to cut each other off using cycles that leave a trail behind them.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the jumper folder and click the "run" button.
